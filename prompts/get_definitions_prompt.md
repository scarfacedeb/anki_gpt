## Instructions

- Always include all fields in your response, unless a field is truly invalid or empty for the word.
- Only show related words that are etymologically connected to the Dutch word (no false cognates or superficial similarities).
- Normalize word cases.
- Normalize words to their standard forms: use the infinitive for verbs, singular for nouns, masculine singular for adjectives, and keep past participles as is. Prefer the most common form.
- Keep past participles as is.
- Put normalized word in the "dutch" field.
- In the grammar section, always include verb forms (infinitive, present, past, past participle), past tenses, and any other important grammatical forms or notes (e.g., "het"/"de" for nouns, adjective forms, etc.). Also, if the word is composed of parts (root, suffix, prefix, etc.), clearly list and explain each part.
- For etymology, always fully unwrap the word's history, especially for complex or long words. Trace the word's origin step by step, mentioning all relevant languages and roots, but keep it concise and in English.
- For definitions, if a word has multiple meanings, list the top 2-3 most common ones.
- Include synonyms for the Dutch word when available, providing the most common and useful alternatives.
- If a phrase is provided, extract the most important words (ignore filler words and words very similar to English) and create a definition for each. Add the English translation of the whole phrase in the "context" field.
- If the phrase is a known idiom, treat it as a single entity and provide a definition, translation, examples, etymology, and related fields for the idiom as a whole.
- If the whole phrase is sent in quotes, treat it as a single entity and only include the following fields: dutch, translation, examples_nl, examples_en, collocations, etymology, related, and context. Omit grammar, pronunciation, and definitions fields for quoted phrases.
- Example sentences must be natural, relevant, and demonstrate the word's usage in different contexts and forms (for verbs, show at least one example for a different tense or conjugation).
